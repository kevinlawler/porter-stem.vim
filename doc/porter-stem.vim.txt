" PorterStem is a vim script that implements the Porter stemming
" algorithm, by Martin Porter, details of which can be found at:
"   http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/
" The main function outputs the single string of the stem, and the script only
" echoes the output to the screen. This script, while it can be used as-is
" if you want to know what the stem for a word is, is mostly a container for 
" the algorithm implementation in vim script.
" 
" PorterStem command syntax:
"   :PorterStem (<word>)*
"
" Each word input to the :PorterStem command will be stemmed and processed by
" the ProcessStem function, that by default simply echoes to the screen.
" Without any word given for input, it will attempt to stem the current word 
" under the cursor via expand('<cword>').
"
" For example:
"   :PorterStem searching
" will output:
"   search
" and a string of words will work as well, matching in order:
"   :PorterStem thieves are running from the bunny
" will output:
"   thiev are run from bunni
"
" Running :PorterTest <test-file> <expected-results-file> will run each 
" word in <test-file> and match the stem result to the same line in the 
" <expected-results-file>, showing if any are incorrect stem matches.
" Provided in the github repository are two files voc.txt and output.txt 
" from Martin Porter's site providing a set of test words.
"
" The plugin also provides a function GetWordStem(word) for public use. For
" example:
"
"   echomsg "The stem for stemming is" GetWordStem('stemming')
"
" will output:
"
"   The stem for stemming is stem
